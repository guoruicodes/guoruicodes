Summary
I was given a Chinese name some time ago by a Chinese friend.
I've currently adopted it's usage online in preference to my given name in an effort to tackle what seems to be rising hate crimes against people of Asian descent at this volatile time.
For English speakers, it’s approximate pronunciation is
"Gu-Oh Roo-Ay"
Thank you

Engineering Manager @ Ericsson (lead) 2014 - 2017
    Summary: Line Manger and Technical Lead. Developing a greenfield, Netflix-like IPTV product. Distributed system architecture. Microservices (C#, ASP.NET Web API, MVC, REST API, kafka, Cassandra, DynamoDB) ,UX development (JS/TS/JQuery),Azure/AWS
    15 developer reports, 2 teams. My role was 70% hands on technical, 30% management.
    I was part of the leadership team that transitioned Ericsson from a waterfall development structure to an agile scrum structure using industry best practice combined engineering, feature teams, CI/CD and devops. And away from Microsoft technologies and towards open source.
    First team: 7 developers
    Developed a single page application (SPA) web app in Javascript and Typescript using React/Backbone as the framework. Underscore, JQuery, REST, HTML, CSS.
    Second team: 8 developers
    Devops running and developing an in production C# cloud (Azure/AWS) hosted service (ASP.NET)
    I led the technical effort to migrate this service from a team in the UK to the team in Dublin. Due to changing business environment I had to complete this move successfully in only 6 weeks instead of the planned 6 months. It was business / mission critical that I succeeded in the 6 week timeframe (the UK office was closing). It was the “Ingestion” service - allows new content (movies etc) to be added (uploaded / transcoded / encrypted / packaged) into the platform.
    Architecture: As much smarts as possible pushed into the cloud. Some logic running client side in the SPA. Kafka based message queues. Moved to a microservices based architecture.
    Team: Three week sprints, sprint planning, daily standups, user story grooming and retrospectives. JIRA, Confluence, Gitlab, Slack
    Weekly 1:1’s with my reports, annual goal setting, annual reviews, career development. Coaching of reports.
    Attended program level sprint review meetings every 3 weeks to review progress at an organisational level. Attended weekly leaders meetings to discuss issues and plan as well as planning overall quarterly and yearly strategy. Attended leadership offsites and training.

    I have extensive experience of MongoDB - of production deployments and cluster administration and of developing applications that run against MongoDB and also knowledge of schema design and performance.
    If you called or emailed MongoDB in 2012 while NY were offline you came through to me. I was MongoDB worldwide support. When Eliot (CEO MongoDB) went offline at around 2am UK time, there was no MongoDB support until I came online at about 6am.

Software Developer @ Lake Communications 2010 - 2010
    Summary: Developing an embedded linux VOIP product in C and C++. Linux driver development. Hacking in assembly. Linux kernel hacking. Working in agile but with in house hardware team working in waterfall.
    Developed embedded wireless router that could also handle VOIP calls. It ran an embedded linux kernel (2.6.20) on an ARM architecture microcontroller (MIPS24KEc) from Infineon (Danube).
    Worked in C in the linux kernel. I wrote low level device drivers for the DSP and ISDN chips. There were some interesting moments in assembly.
    I also worked in C++ at application level to implement the telephony functions.
    In my first few days they told me trying to get the required performance out of the chip was a huge problem. They had both a team of software engineers and a team of hardware engineers working on it - on my 11th day there I pointed out a solution to this - that the chip they were using was in fact dual core. They were using it as a single core and could compile their linux kernel to use the second core.

    Software Developer @ Cinnara Ltd 2007 - 2009
    Summary: Developing a very high speed packet processing product. Writing network protocol handlers from RFCs. Linux kernel hacking. Linux drivers. C++.
    Developed an advanced service monitor for GPRS packet data networks. Multithreaded C++ application which ran on a dedicated multi-cpu server. It was sold to major telecom companies and monitored traffic on their GPRS data network. It “sniffed” packets from the wire and analysed those packets using a network protocol stack. The process worked at approaching line speed (10Gbs).
